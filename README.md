# Eternal Wordle

> Yet another Wordle clone.

It's [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) but with multiple words being guessed simultaneously (like [Dordle](https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle), [Quordle](quordle.com) or [Octordle](https://octordle.com/)) but also when you guess a word, it is replaced with a new one. The game keeps going until you fail to guess a word.
